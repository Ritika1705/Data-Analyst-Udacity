# Data-Ananlyst-Udacity
Udacity data analyst course

In this project, I have added all the files that were required to complete a data analyst nanodegree course.
From data gathering to data visualization, the degree introduced me to several minute details involved in the course of data analysis. I learnt to work with some awesome statistical tools like A/B testing along with various probability concepts. I also gained insights into various data visualization techniques.
Working on 4 different industry level projects, was a completely new experience.
